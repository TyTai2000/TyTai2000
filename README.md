## üëã Hi, I'm Taiwo Akingbesote

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Quantitative Finance** and **Data Science** enthusiast passionate about solving complex financial problems and automating processes using cutting-edge technologies. Currently, I'm pursuing my M.S. in **Quantitative Finance / Financial Mathematics** at Rutgers Business School, specializing in **Machine Learning**.

With experience in both academic and professional settings, I've worked on projects ranging from **Monte Carlo Simulations for options pricing (ongoing)** to building **machine learning models** for stock price and to appraise soccer players‚Äô market value using FIFA 23 Official Dataset
 prediction. I'm constantly learning and exploring new ways to apply **data science** and **engineering principles** to finance, and technology
